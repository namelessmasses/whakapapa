# .dot files are not Word Templates

These .dot files are a diagram format for the [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) tool. 

If you are using Microsoft Windows and have knowledge of Powershell, use the `Build-Diagrams.ps1` script to generate the diagrams.
The script will search for the `dot` executable. If one can't be found, it will install Graphviz using `winget` (Windows Package Manager).
