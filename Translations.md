## ChatGPT Translation

Roro came to Turanga at Titirangi. He came through Turanga via Waipoa, where his boundary is at Kereruhuahua, and he crossed onto the totara tree, which is called Te Whakaumua Roro. That side belongs to the Aitanga a Mahaki, and this side to Ngatiporou and Ngatiira. He came to Huatara Korero (in the vicinity of Huiarua at Tauwhareparae), within Te Mata, and settled there. Upon his arrival, he said to Ngatiira, "In the future, you will hear that the belly of this woman will swell and oil will be produced for the tuatanga."

This statement referred to his wife, Te Aningaiao, who was pregnant. Their group included him, Rakaihoea, Puku, and Te Kakara (their sister).

Here is the genealogy for clarification: 

---

It is clear here that Roro and his group were a significant part of Ngatiira on one side, and from Turanga on the other. Their significant side towards Waiapu belonged to Rakaimataura. Te Aningaiao, Roro’s wife, was from Te Aomihia of Ngatihau and Kahupakari of Materoa. When Roro and his group arrived at Waiapu, they settled in the village at Koputerehu. Te Hukui was born there. News reached Ngatiira, and Ngatiira came and met Roro and the Kaihinu. Some say that the Kaihinu took place across from Waiapu at Turitaka, where Roro’s village was. The name of Roro’s house, where the Kaihinu was formalized, was Matohuarau.

When Ngatiira arrived, they were seen by Rangirakaikura from his village at Pohatukura (above Kaharau). The group proceeded via Oruru and marched directly below his village without stopping. Rangirakaikura felt wronged because of the theft of the oils from him. He devised a plan for the return of the group from Waiapu. He built his shelter and named it Tapaturauaruhe – constructed with fern fronds to hasten the covering since it could not be roofed with toetoe. This shelter was outside Oruru in the area of Otakehia. Ngatiira was welcomed inside the shelter, but at dawn, they were attacked. The tribe fled and were pursued and killed. The survivors carried the news back.

When news reached Waiapu, Roro and his group prepared for action. Roro, Rakaihoea, and Ngatiporou set out. They arrived at Makaraka, beyond Mangahanea, and encountered Te Hekeroa, the younger brother of Te Rangirakaikura. Te Hekeroa was killed. It is said there was a village there which was attacked. They then moved on to Waitetoki and attacked the village above Waitetoki in the Pakuri area, named Tarakihitapia. The village and its inhabitants were killed. The group returned, and this was Roro’s retribution for the murder.

[^1]: “Ngakinga mate” refers to the act of avenging a death.
 
When news reached Ngatiira, a group led by Tauira set out. They attacked Rangirakaikura’s village, Pohatukura, finding only the women and children there. Rangirakaikura and his children were in the forest. The women of the village, including Rautu and her children Raukohe and Raumarie, were taken captive by Ngatiira. When Rangirakaikura returned, he found that the group and the women had been taken. They pursued them.

Ngatiira traveled to Omanuka, beyond Marahea and closer to Anaura by the coast. As they approached their homes, the group decided to cook food and the captive women. They lit the ovens and prepared mats. As they were about to kill the women, Rautu recognized Rangirakaikura’s garment from afar. Rangirakaikura was on a ridge at Tirohaupo near Omanuka. The woman said to Ngatiira, “Wait, do not kill us, let us perform a haka for you.” They picked up the mats with their hands and danced around the oven. The gesture of their haka was a signal to Rangirakaikura. Eventually, the women’s clothes fell off, and they stood naked, waving their arms. The haka went like this:

---

> E hine Rautu! Rautu!
> 
> Raukohe! Raukohe!
> 
> Raumarie!
> 
> Where have you emerged?
> 
> Have you emerged outside?
> 
> Have you emerged to the coast?
> 
> Alas! Alas! Alas!
> 
> My skin
> 
> Is in pain!

(Note: “E hine” is a term of endearment meaning “Oh girl” or “Oh daughter,” and “Mamaetia” means “is in pain” or “is hurting.”)

The words of the haka were repeated, distracting the group with their performance and laughter. Rangirakaikura and his group attacked, leading to a great slaughter of Ngatiira.
